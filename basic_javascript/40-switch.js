/*
Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you need to match one value against many options, you can use a switch statement. A switch statement compares the value to the case statements which define various possible values. Any valid JavaScript statements can be executed inside a case block and will run from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("The fruit is an apple");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("The fruit is an orange");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - alpha
2 - beta
3 - gamma
4 - delta
*/

function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case 1:
      answer = "alpha";
      break;
    case 2:
      answer = "beta";
      break;
    case 3:
      answer = "gamma";
      break;
    case 4:
      answer = "delta";
      break;
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);

/*
Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}
Write a switch statement to set answer for the following conditions:
a - apple
b - bird
c - cat
default - stuff
*/

function switchOfStuff(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case "a":
      answer = "apple";
      break;

    case "b":
      answer = "bird";
      break;

    case "c":
      answer = "cat";
      break;
    
    default:
      answer = "stuff";
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

switchOfStuff(1);

/*
Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

let result = "";
switch (val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
1-3 - Low
4-6 - Mid
7-9 - High
*/

function sequentialSizes(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      answer = "Low";
      break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      answer = "Mid";
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      answer = "High";
      break;
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

sequentialSizes(1);

/*
Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:

if (val === 1) {
  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {
  answer = "b";
} else {
  answer = "c";
}
can be replaced with:

switch (val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "a";
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";
}
Change the chained if/else if statements into a switch statement.
*/

function chainToSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
switch (val) {
    case "bob":
      answer = "Marley";
      break;
    case 42:
      answer = "The Answer";
      break;
    case 1:
      answer = "There is no #1";
      break;
    case 99:
      answer = "Missed me by this much!";
      break;
    case 7:
      answer = "Ate Nine";
      break;
    default:
      answer = "";
      break;
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

chainToSwitch(7);
