Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

5   >  3  // true
7   > '3' // true
2   >  3  // false
'1' >  9  // false



Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

Examples

6   >=  6  // true
7   >= '3' // true
2   >=  3  // false
'7' >=  9  // false



Comparison with the Less Than Operator
The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.

Examples

2   < 5 // true
'3' < 7 // true
5   < 5 // false
3   < 2 // false
'8' < 4 // false


Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

Examples

4   <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true
5   <= 5 // true
3   <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false


Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if.

if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
This code will return Yes if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written with the logical and operator.

if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";

*/
function testLogicalAnd(val) {
  // Only change code below this line

  if (val <= 50 && val >= 25) {
      return "Yes";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return "No";
}

testLogicalAnd(10);

/*
Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints.

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
This code will return Yes if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written with the logical or operator.

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
Combine the two if statements into one statement which returns the string Outside if val is not between 10 and 20, inclusive. Otherwise, return the string Inside.
*/

function testLogicalOr(val) {
  // Only change code below this line

  if (val < 10 || val > 20) {
    return "Outside";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return "Inside";
}

testLogicalOr(15);
